Rutuja_6153

This document covers the usage and the design decisions made when developing the PrP2 code.

Usage:-
Step 1: Change directory to the location the file has been downloaded.

Step 2: Compile the Java Code
	The code is written in a two java files one for hits(Hits6153.java) and other for page rank(Pgrk6153.java).
	We can compile the files using the commands:"javac Hits6153.java" and "javac Pgrk6153.java" respectively.(ignore the double quotes while executing)

Step 3: For running the hits algorithm use: "java Hits6153 <iterations> <initialvalue> <filename>" (ignore the double quotes while executing).

	For running the page rank algorithm use: "java Pgrk6153 <iterations> <initialvalue> <filename>" (ignore the double quotes while executing).
	Note :- Preferably use the complete file path in place of filename.

Design Decisions:-

Hits:- 
1. Number of arguments passed should be exactly equal to three.
2. Iterations and initial value has to be integer values.
3. Each line in the file should be two integers separated by a space.
4. The first line of the file should contain two numbers, the number of vertices followed by number of edges.
5. Iterations values cannot be less than -6.
6. The possible initial values are -2, -1, 0, 1 only.
7. The number of lines in the input file after the first line has to be equal to the number of edges as provided in line 1.

Page rank:- 
1. Number of arguments passed should be exactly equal to three.
2. Iterations and initial value has to be integer values.
3. Each line in the file should be two integers separated by a space.
4. The first line of the file should contain two numbers, the number of vertices followed by number of edges.
5. Iterations values cannot be less than -6.
6. The possible initial values are -2, -1, 0, 1 only.
7. The number of lines in the input file after the first line has to be equal to the number of edges as provided in line 1.
